# Machine Learning Portfolio

**Author**: Jaime Blanco Linares.


This repository gathers some of my public Machine Learning work. Each project is constructed on a Jupyter Notebook, which contains **Python** code, text explainations and figures.

## Projects

- ### Linear Regression

  - [Simple Linear Regression - *Boston Housing Dataset*](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/P1_SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb): Predicting the median value of a house based on the *number of rooms*. Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis**,  **Ordinary Least Squares regression** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.
  
  - [Multiple Linear Regression - *Boston Housing Dataset*](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/P2_MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb): Predicting the median value of a house according to the *number of rooms*, *percentage of lower status population* and *pupil-teacher ratio*. Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Ordinary Least Squares regression** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.
  
- ### Polynomial Regression

  - [Polynomial Regression - Insurance Claims Dataset](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/P3_PolynomialRegression.ipynb): Predicting the number of complaints in an insurance company by year. Includes a comparison between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression, **Ordinary Least Squares in Polynomial Regression** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.

- ### Logistic Regression

  - [Logistic Regression - Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/maintenance): (UNDER MAINTENANCE) Predicting whether the identified cells are Benign or Malignant. Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.

- ### Classification, Supervised Learning

  - [K-Nearest Neighbours - Wine dataset](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/maintenance): (UNDER MAINTENANCE) Classifying unlabeled wines according to their characteristic attributes, such as their alcohol content, acidity or magnesium levels, among others. Includes an **in-house implementation based on the k-NN theory** (in which dataset wines are identified and represented by colors) and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation with **k-Fold Cross-Validation**.
