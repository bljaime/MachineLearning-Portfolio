# Machine Learning Portfolio

**Author**: Jaime Blanco Linares.


This repository gathers all my public Machine Learning work. Each project is constructed on a Jupyter Notebook, which contains python code, text explainations and figures.

## Projects

- ### Linear Regression

  - [Simple Linear Regression - *Boston Housing Dataset*](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/P1_SimpleLinearRegression.ipynb): Predicting the median value of a house based on the *number of rooms*. Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis**,  **Ordinary Least Squares regression** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.
  
  - [Multiple Linear Regression - *Boston Housing Dataset*](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/P2_MultipleLinearRegression.ipynb): Predicting the median value of a house according to the *number of rooms*, *percentage of lower status population* and *pupil-teacher ratio*. Includes **Exploratory Data Analysis**, **Ordinary Least Squares regression** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.

  - [Polynomial Regression - Insurance Claims Dataset](https://github.com/bljaime/MachineLearning-Portfolio/blob/master/P3_PolynomialRegression.ipynb): Predicting the number of complaints in an insurance company by year. Includes a comparison between Polynomial Regression and Linear Regression, **Ordinary Least Squares in Polynomial Regression** and **Scikit-learn’s** implementation.
